Quick project to print Lorem Ipsum text to the Cli.

It won't generate unique Lorem Ipsum, but can handle multiple paragraphs of the same text.

To add, set the file as executable using:


```
chmod +x lorem.py
```

If you would like to have it executable from anywhere, you can create a symlink to your /usr/bin/
Or, add the script path to your .bashrc (Or similar file such as .zshrc)
```
export PATH=/path/to/script:$PATH
```
